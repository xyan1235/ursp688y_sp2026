    "## Problem\n",
    "Montgomery County gets many requests for service from its agencies. The County wants to understand more about what types of requests are most common and where they come from.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please use your new Python skills and data about requests in January to help the County understand:\n",
    "1. How many times did each type of request get made?\n",
    "2. How many times did requests get made from each city?\n",
    "\n",
    "First write pseudocode to answer these questions. Then write a Python program around the pseudocode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional: See if you can write a function to package your analysis and return results. How can you use arguments to generalize the function so it can answer either of the questions above?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a dictionary with a few hundred records of service requests from a dataset available on Montgomery County's [Open Data Portal](https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Community-Recreation/Agency-Service-Requests/5diu-yj9e/about_data). I queried requests made so-far in 2026 and stored them in a basic data structure called json (JavaScript Object Notation).\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, the County got a lot of requests in less than a month!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints\n",
    "- There are many possible ways to program this. don't worry about finding the \"right\" or \"best\" one. Figure out one way that works, and then refine it if you see opportunities.\n",
    "- `for` loops may be useful for iterating through lists and dictionaries.\n",
    "- You may want to define one or more variables and update them on each loop to keep track of counts or things your has 'seen' in the data.\n",
    "- `service_requests` is a list with dictionaries nested inside it--a list of dictionaries.\n",
    "- To access the dictionaries inside the list, you may want to use nested loops: one loop inside another loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting\n",
    "1. Make a new branch in your fork of the course repository.\n",
    "2. Save a copy of your notebook with your first name as an underscored suffix (e.g., `exercise01_chester.ipynb`).\n",
    "3. Commit and push your saved notebook to your fork on Github.\n",
    "4. Make a pull request to the base course repository."
